# api-testing-clojure

API testing with clojure clj-http library. Testing is done using free APIs from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

## Getting started

There are a few prerequisites to run the tests.

### Installation on Your Machine
1. JDK (I recommend Java 11 or 16). [Here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) are some installation tips from Oracle.
2. [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), a build tool for Clojure.

### Running tests locally

Before running any tests it's recommended to run
```
lein deps
```
to download all necessary dependencies.

Tests can be run by using the following command in your terminal:
```
lein run-tests 
```
or
```
./run-tests
```
